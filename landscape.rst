Getting started with Landscape
-------------------------------

Before you can access your Landscape SaaS account for the first time, you need to follow the steps under :doc: Account set-up `<account-setup>`.

For customers using self-hosted Landscape, your ``licence.txt`` file is available in your Landscape SaaS account. You will need to re-download and apply new ``licence.txt`` files every time you purchase new Ubuntu Pro licences and after every renewal.

.. tip::
    New ``licence.txt`` files become available on their start date. For renewal customers, this is the day after your old licences expire.
