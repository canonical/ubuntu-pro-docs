Getting started with Landscape
------------------------------

Landscape SaaS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you can access your Landscape SaaS account for the first time, you need to follow the steps under :doc:`Account set-up <account-setup>`.

.. _self-hosted-landscape:

Self-hosted Landscape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After `setting up your self-hosted Landscape server <https://ubuntu.com/landscape/install>`_, you need to choose a licensing mechanism. There are two options for self-hosted Landscape: the new, Pro client method and the old, licence.txt file method.

**Pro client method**

For customers running Landscape version 23.03 or newer and landscape-client version 23.02 or newer, please use the Pro client method to license your Landscape server.

1. Ensure the Pro client is :ref:`installed and attached to your Pro token <get_token_and_attach>` on the system you wish to register to Landscape.
2. Then :ref:`enable Landscape <manage-landscape>` to initiate the registration process.
3. Landscape will detect your Pro entitlement via the Pro token and create a licence for your machine.

**Licence.txt file method**

For customers on an older version of Landscape or landscape-client than those specified above, please download your ``licence.txt`` file from your Landscape SaaS account. You will need to re-download and apply new ``licence.txt`` files every time you purchase new Ubuntu Pro licences and after every renewal.

.. tip::

   New ``licence.txt`` files become available on their start date. For renewal customers, this is the day after your old licences expire.
