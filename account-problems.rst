If you have problems with your Ubuntu Pro account
=================================================

.. _password-reset-problems:

Password reset
------------------------

The first thing to check is that you have created an Ubuntu One account (note that we do not do this for you). 

Follow the instructions at :ref:`create-ubuntu-one-account` *carefully*, then come back here.

..  admonition:: If that hasn't solved your problem

    Check that you are using the correct email address: ask the person who set up your organisation's Ubuntu Pro subscription and try again.

    Find the original "Welcome to Ubuntu Pro" message we sent you, and contact the Customer Success team with the details provided.

    If you cannot find the welcome message, go to `https://ubuntu.com/ <https://ubuntu.com/>`_ and ask for Customer Success contact details using the LiveChat service. 
    

.. _portal-access-problems:

Portal access
-------------

The Ubuntu Pro portals are:

* `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <http://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_
* `Canonical Support Portal <https://support-portal.canonical.com>`_
* `Landscape SaaS <http://landscape.canonical.com/>`_

Users will not have access to the Ubuntu Pro portals, unless they have been added as a new user on each one. Simply having an Ubuntu One account does not automatically give a user access.

If you need access to a portal, ask the person who set up your organisation's Ubuntu Pro subscription to add you to the portals required.

..  important:

    Ensure that each individual user on your organisation's Ubuntu Pro account creates their own Ubuntu One account. Accounts cannot be shared by multiple users. Trying to share accounts will often trigger errors.
