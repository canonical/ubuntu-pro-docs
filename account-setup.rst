Ubuntu Pro: general account setup
=================================

Welcome to Ubuntu Pro, for new subscribers and users. 

**Take five-minutes to work through this introduction to the basics of your Ubuntu Pro subscription.** This will ensure that when you need help, you know where to go and how to get it, quickly and efficiently.

..  admonition:: Are you on a metered plan purchased directly from AWS or Azure?

    If you're on a metered plan, this document does not apply to you. Instead see: 
    
    * `Get started with Ubuntu Pro on AWS <https://ubuntu.com/engage/aws-pro-onboarding>`_
    * `Get started with Ubuntu Pro on Azure <https://ubuntu.com/engage/azure-pro-onboarding>`_      


Ubuntu One
----------

The first thing we need you to do is log in.

Access to the Ubuntu Pro customer portals is mediated through **Ubuntu One Single Sign On**. If you have an Ubuntu One account already, go straight to :ref:`log in to the Ubuntu Pro dashboard <dashboard-log-in>`.

.. _create-ubuntu-one-account:

If you do not already have an Ubuntu One account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to know the correct email address for the account (this will be the same email address to which your "Welcome to Ubuntu Pro" message was sent). 

If you don't know the address, ask the person who set up your organisation's Ubuntu Pro subscription.

Go to `Ubuntu One <http://login.ubuntu.com>`_ and select *I do not have an Ubuntu One account*.

Create a new account, using the email address associated with your Ubuntu Pro subscription as the "Preferred email address".

(If you get a message "An Ubuntu One account already exists with this email", please see :ref:`password-reset-problems`.)

After verifying your email address, you can access the customer portals. There are three portals: 

* `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_
* `Canonical Support Portal <https://support-portal.canonical.com/dashboard>`_ 
* `Landscape <https://landscape.canonical.com/login/>`_ (additional set-up will be required) 

.. _dashboard-log-in:

Ubuntu Pro dashboard
--------------------

Open the `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <http://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`__. This dashboard gives you an overview of your current Ubuntu Pro subscriptions. 

Ubuntu Pro token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here you can see your subscriptions and the **Ubuntu Pro tokens** associated with them. The tokens are required to enable many Ubuntu Pro services. When a service requires your token, get it from here.

For more information about using the Ubuntu Pro token, client, and active machine count, see `Bitstream services: overview & enablement <link tbc>`_.


Add a secondary user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that all customers with commercial subscriptions have a secondary user on the Ubuntu Pro dashboard, to ensure continuity of access.

Check *Account users* from the main menu. If a secondary user is not already listed, add one now.

Canonical Support Portal
------------------------

Open the `Canonical Support Portal <https://support-portal.canonical.com/>`__. The Support Portal provides access to our Knowledge Base. If you have a support contract, this is where to raise support tickets.

Add a secondary user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As before, we recommend adding a secondary user to the portal, to ensure continuity of access.

Open the User menu, and select *My account*. 

..  image:: /images/portal-user-menu.png
    :alt: The user menu is the last item in the main menu

If a secondary user is not already listed, add one now with the *New user* button. Also select the *Active Ubuntu Pro user* option, so that the new contact is enabled as a Support Portal user.

-----------


Landscape
---------

You will have received an email message inviting you to activate your Landscape account (Subject: "You have been invited to the Landscape account [â€¦]", from ``noreply+landscape@canonical.com``). 

If you haven't already done so, accept the invitation now and follow the instructions. (If you can't find the message, check your spam filter, and then ask us.)

You can always log in to the account at `Landscape SaaS <http://landscape.canonical.com/>`_.

Once again, we recommend adding a secondary user to the portal, to ensure continuity of access: *Administrators* > *Invite an administrator*.

If you are having problems accessing the portals, please see :ref:`Portal access problems <portal-access-problems>`.
