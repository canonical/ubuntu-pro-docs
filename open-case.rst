How to open a case
==================

To get the best (and fastest possible) results from Canonical Support, take a few moments to ensure that you provide us with the information we need to help you:

Log in to the `Support Portal <https://support-portal.canonical.com/dashboard>`_.

Search the Canonical Knowledge Base for articles relevant to your case - your issue may already have a solution.

If no solution is available in the Knowledge Base, select the **New ticket** button on the homepage.

Complete the ticket form. Most fields are self-explanatory, but note:

:guilabel:`Description` - include:

* exact time & date the problem occurred
* what the steps or actions you took
* what was the result of that action
* what you expected or wanted to happen
* any other information you think is relevant
* any logs, error messages, screenshots

:guilabel:`Impact` - tell us how the problem affects your organisation

If you are able to share a *sosreport* (below), this will help us respond faster and more accurately.


Sosreports
----------

Canonical uses sosreports, or "state of system" reports, to diagnose and resolve problems. These comprise system logs and configuration data.

When you report a problem with your Ubuntu machine, you can generate and send a sosreport from the affected machine straight away.

Refer to the following articles for information on using sosreports:

* `Installing the sosreport tool and generating a sosreport <https://support-portal.canonical.com/knowledge-base/canonical-support-data-collection-sosreport>`_
* `Sending a sosreport to Canonical <https://support-portal.canonical.com/knowledge-base/sending-files-sts>`_
* `Essential commands for sosreport, including data obfuscation/report cleaning <https://support-portal.canonical.com/knowledge-base/Essential-commands-for-troubleshooting-with-sosreport>`_
