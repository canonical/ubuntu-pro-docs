Ubuntu Pro for airgapped environments
======================================

Customers with a paid subscription to Ubuntu Pro can set up the included services in environments with limited or no connectivity.

If you need to use the Pro services in an offline environment but do not have a paid subscription, you can purchase a subscription in our `online shop <https://ubuntu.com/pro/subscribe>`_.

Refer to the following articles from our Knowledge Base for instructions on how to set up Ubuntu Pro in offline environments:
