Ubuntu Pro for airgapped environments
======================================

Customers with a paid subscription to Ubuntu Pro can set up the included services in environments with limited or no network connectivity.

Paying customers with Support Portal access should refer to the following articles from our Knowledge Base for instructions on how to set up Ubuntu Pro in offline environments:

 * `Ubuntu Pro client external access requirements <https://support-portal.canonical.com/knowledge-base/UA-Client-External-Access-Requirements>`_: this article outlines the specific ports and URLs needed for each Ubuntu Pro bitstream service.
 * `Get started with Ubuntu Pro in an airgapped environment <https://support-portal.canonical.com/knowledge-base/Get-Started-With-Ubuntu-Pro-in-an-Airgapped-Environment>`_.
 * For instructions on how to create local mirrors to make the Pro services available to offline systems, search in the Knowledge Base for “SERVICE_NAME offline”.
 
 If you need to use the Pro services in an offline environment but do not have a paid subscription, purchase one in our `online shop <https://ubuntu.com/pro/subscribe>`_.
